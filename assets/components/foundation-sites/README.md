# [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com)

This is the supremely in-development version of Foundation for Sites 6.0.

Requires NodeJS to be installed on your machine. Works with 0.10, 0.12, and 4.1! **Note that parts of our build process will break with NPM 3, due to the changes in how packages are installed.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-6.git
cd foundation-sites-6
npm install && bower install
npm start
```
